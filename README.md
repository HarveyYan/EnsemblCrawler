# EnsemblCrawler
A simple python crawler alternative, when you are either discouraged by ensembl biomart or its bloody perl interface

It basically shows you how to download cDNA and 3'UTR. Simple multi"threading" is also used.

May not be as effcient as Biomart...But anyway, has ensembl export (of large quantity of sequences) ever worked? 

It's a good tradeoff, between slowness and impossibility(or eternal annoyance).
